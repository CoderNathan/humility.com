<h1>What is Humility?</h1>
<h2><p>Humility is the accepted act of aprroving the quality of not being too proud of yourself.</p></h2>
<h1> What is Pride?🤔</h1>
<p><h2>Pride is the act of boastful composure,speech,and mindset towards others who aren't up to your status.</h2></p>

<h1>Why Does Care and Cuddles School Dispute Pride?😊</h1>
<p><h2>In Care and Cuddles School we call our school the "No to Pride" school because when it comes to pride 
we dispute the need for pride in school. Our head of school Mrs. Nguavese Idiabana has given her utmost best to completely
erradicate pride from our school.To do this she needs the best of teachers and discipline to improve the welfare
of the pupils. Care and Cuddles School has a very conduesive learing atmostsphere and a competitive academic environment
that is why Care and Cuddles School is one of the top 10 pride erradication schools in Nigeria.</h2></p>

<h1>Let's take an example💡</h1>
<h2>Jason is a very humble boy and one of the most popular students because of his humility. He's not feared nor is he 
disrespected, he's respected and loved by both teachers and students.<br>
<p></p>

<h2>Drake is a very proud student in his school because he's family is very wealthy therefore not every
one in school likes him and no one wants to be he's friend due to his pride.</h2>
<p></p>
<br>


<h1>Activities we do to promote Humility😀</h1>
<h2> <ol>
   <li>We hold mentorship classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays between 8:00am - 8:20am to give a better understanding
    amongst students. We separate students into boys and girls.<br></li>
<li>We invite special guest to teach our students more about the concept of humility and why it's 
    important and relevant in school.</li> 
<li>We make sure students don't get too proud because of their grade or wealth that's why we sometimes take disciplanary actions towards the child to erradicte any sense of pride in the child's mindset.<br>
</li>
